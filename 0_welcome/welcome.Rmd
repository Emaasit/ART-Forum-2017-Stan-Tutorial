## What is Stan?
> Stan is freedom-respecting open-source software for facilitating statistical inference at the frontiers of applied statistics.

## What is (Bayesian) statistical inference? 
```{r, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Bayesian_Inference.png")
```  

## Software options for Bayesian estimation
- Write-your-own sampler
- Purpose built routines for individual models  
    + MCMCPack R package  
    + Stata's Bayesian package 
    + Sawtooth CBC/HB 
- Tools which automatically build samplers for a wide class of models  
    + WinBugs  
    + JAGS  
    + Stan  

## Why Stan? 
- Ideal tool for rapid prototyping of new models
- Modern, thoughful software design
- Increasingly attractive option for fitting even standard Bayesian models

## Tutorial modules
- Module 1: Linear regression model  
    + Get up-and-running with Stan  
- Module 2: Multinomial logit model  
    + Learn basic Stan syntax  
    + Test a model using synthetic data  
- Module 3: Hierarchial multinomial logit model  
    + Learn more Stan syntax  
    + Work with hierarchical models  
- Module 4: Nested hierarchical multinomial logit  
    + Illustrate development of new models using Stan  
- Bonus: Data fusion for split questionares   

## A word of warning
Our focus here is on becoming a capable *user* of Stan, so we won't be spending much time talking about how Stan works internally or how it compares to other Bayesian software or classical inference. 

## Presenters
- **Kevin Van Horn** Senior Data Science Engineer at Adobe  
    + Develops commercial-quality software for Bayesian estimation and experimental design  
  
- **Elea McDonnell Feit** Assistant Professor of Marketing at Drexel University and Senior Fellow of the Wharton Customer Analtyics Initiative  
    + Develops tutorials for practitioners in hierarchical Bayes, R, advertising measurement, and field experiments  

## To follow you will need to install: 
- R statistical language  
    + Manages data input, inspection and cleaning 
    + Stores and summarizes posterior draws
    + Provides graphics
- R studio (optional)
    + Convenient user interface for R
- Rstan package
    + Modeling language
    + Statistical inference engine  

## Code files
Within the folder for each module, you will find:  
- `.html`: slides for the module   
- `.R`: R code for the module, so you can follow along  
- `.csv`: data file we will use for estimation  

There are other files in each module folder, which we will explain later.
